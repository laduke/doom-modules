#+TITLE: doom emacs js hacks

* Description
trying to make js/ts work better for me
relies on doom emacs

put in ~/.doom.d/modules/tl

in doom.d/init.el:
add to

#+begin_src lisp
(doom!
       :tl
       js
)
#+end_src


use `(lsp +eglot)` instead of just `lsp`

do Not enable doom's javascript module in init.el

`(lsp +eglot)` will change the lsp client for other languages, like rust and go. Seems fine if not better so far.
