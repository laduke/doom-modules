#+TITLE: doom emacs javascript module

* Description
Trying to make js{x}/ts{x} work better in doom emacs

Indentation, Highlighting, and LSP work.

* Install
Clone this repo in:

```
~/.doom.d/modules/tl
```

in doom.d/init.el:
add:

#+begin_src lisp
(doom!
       :tl
       js
)
#+end_src


in doom.d/init.el use:

#+begin_src lisp
(lsp +eglot)
#+end_src

instead of just
#+begin_src lisp
lsp
#+end_src


 This might/will change the lsp client to eglot for other languages, like rust and go. This seems fine if not better so far.

Do Not enable doom's javascript module in init.el

* More info
This doesn't use any of the ancient, built in javascript emacs stuff. It's new blank major mode, so the old modes like js2 don't load.

Eglot for the LSP client. Flycheck just works.

Tree Sitter for syntax highlighting and indentation
